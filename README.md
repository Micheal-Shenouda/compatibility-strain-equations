General compatibility strain equation: e ji,kl + e kl,ji - e ki,jl - e jl,ki = 0
This code written to reduce the 81 equations of compatibility strain in 3D, By removing repeated equations and trivial equations(when all terms cancel each other)
Due to symmetry and continuity, Then eji,kl = eij,kl = eji,lk = eij,lk
